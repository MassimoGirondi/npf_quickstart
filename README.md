# A quick start on NPF

Just some examples and skeleton code that I use in my projects.

The idea is that you have a common .npf file that includes many other, and you invoke it with `run_npf_*.sh` helpers.
So that you have one helper for any experiment, but only one .npf script for all experiments that are closely related.

In the script I reference to a npf repository in the home folder, but you can replace that with the simple `npf-compare` installed with pip3.
